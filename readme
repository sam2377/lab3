A:
	compile: make
	execute: ./hw3
B:
	output for size = 1000:
		sort(): 230 seconds
		v1/v2 are different.
		insertion_sort(): 10989 seconds
		v1/v2 are the same.
	
	output for size = 10000:
		sort(): 3033 seconds
		v1/v2 are different.
		insertion_sort(): 1.03552e+06 seconds
		v1/v2 are the same.
	
	ouput for size = 100000:
		sort(): 36866 seconds
		v1/v2 are different.
		...
		...
		...    

	In conclusion, the time complexity for O(nlog(n)) is faster than O(n^2).
	sort() is faster than insertion sort.
	The gap will increase by the number of data.
